## Howzit 👋 I'm Daniel de Barros.
####  (But everyone calls me DB)
I am a passionate and alturistic engineer with a focus on control systems, software and medical devices - passionate about relieving suffering in the world. Currently, I am in the R&D team at Zimmer Biomet that builds [One Planner Hip 2D](https://www.zimmerbiomet.com/en/products-and-solutions/specialties/hip/one-planner-hip.html) and <a href="{{ '/oph3d' | relative_url }}" target="_blank">3D</a>. When I am not abusing the terminal or trying to center this div, you will most likely find me indulging in some voluntary suffering (🏃🚴‍♂️🏊) or tending to a plethora of plants. 
### Where I'm from

I was born in Johannesburg to Portuguese parents

### What I used to do
I worked for a period of 4 years in the Mining, Oil and Gas and Chemical/Process industries as an EC&I (Electrical, Control and Instrumentation) and Software Engineer, across South Africa and the Netherlands.
